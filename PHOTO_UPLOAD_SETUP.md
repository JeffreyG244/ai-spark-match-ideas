# ðŸš€ Photo Upload Setup Guide - Complete & Reliable

## Current Status: 20% Working (Storage bucket missing)

This guide will get your photo upload feature to **100% reliability** with no shortcuts.

## âš¡ Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket in Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
2. Select your project: `tzskjzkolyiwhijslqmq`
3. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"New Bucket"**
5. Configure the bucket:
   - **Name**: `profile-photos`
   - **Public bucket**: âœ… **Enable** (checked)
   - **File size limit**: `10 MB`
   - **Allowed MIME types**: 
     ```
     image/jpeg
     image/png
     image/webp
     image/gif
     ```

### Step 2: Set Up RLS Policies

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Paste this SQL and run it:

```sql
-- Create RLS policies for profile-photos bucket
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own profile photos" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated 
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'profile-photos' AND 
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profile photos" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated 
USING (bucket_id = 'profile-photos');

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile photos" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-photos' AND 
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile photos" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'profile-photos' AND 
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```
