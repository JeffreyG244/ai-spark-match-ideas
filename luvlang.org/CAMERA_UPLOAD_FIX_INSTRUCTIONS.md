# 🔧 LUVLANG.ORG CAMERA UPLOAD FIX - COMPLETE SETUP GUIDE

## 📋 ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

✅ **Database Schema Mismatch** - Frontend expected `user_id`, `photo_urls` columns that didn't exist  
✅ **Storage Integration** - Photos uploaded to storage but not saved to database  
✅ **Authentication Issues** - RLS policies blocking operations  
✅ **Import Path Errors** - Fixed Supabase client imports  

## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP SETUP

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: `tzskjzkolyiwhijslqmq`
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `database_fixes.sql` (created in your project)
5. Click **Run** to execute the migration

### Step 2: Set Storage Bucket Policies  
1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Click on the `profile-photos` bucket
3. Go to **Policies** tab
4. Add these 4 policies:

**Policy 1: Allow Upload**
```sql
-- Name: Allow authenticated users to upload
-- Operation: INSERT
-- Policy: auth.role() = 'authenticated'
```

**Policy 2: Allow Public View**
```sql  
-- Name: Allow public viewing of photos
-- Operation: SELECT
-- Policy: true
```

**Policy 3: Allow Users to Update Their Photos**
```sql
-- Name: Users can update their own photos
-- Operation: UPDATE  
-- Policy: auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
```

**Policy 4: Allow Users to Delete Their Photos**
```sql
-- Name: Users can delete their own photos
-- Operation: DELETE
-- Policy: auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
```

### Step 3: Test the Setup
Run this command in your project directory:
```bash
node test_camera_upload_fix.mjs
```

You should see:
- ✅ All database columns exist
- ✅ Storage upload working
- ✅ RLS policies configured
